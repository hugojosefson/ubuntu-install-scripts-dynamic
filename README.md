# Ubuntu install scripts

_Install scripts for various things I like to install on a fresh Ubuntu._

They save some keystrokes :) Use the `./all-*` scripts to save even more!

Happy (re-)installing!

## Difference...

...compared to
[my other ubuntu-install-scripts repo](https://github.com/hugojosefson/ubuntu-install-scripts):

This is a re-implementation in JavaScript. It will hopefully be more stable, and
possibly easier to work with.

## TODO

- Use `aptdcon` instead of `apt-get` where possible.
