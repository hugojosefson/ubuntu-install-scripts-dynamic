# Ubuntu install scripts

_Install scripts for various things I like to install on a fresh Ubuntu._

They save some keystrokes :) Use the `./all-*` scripts to save even more!

Happy (re-)installing!

## Difference...

...compared to [my other ubuntu-install-scripts repo](https://github.com/hugojosefson/ubuntu-install-scripts):

Because Node.js programming comes so much more natural for me, than Bash programming, and because I enjoy it so much more, I plan to create a nice dynamic and faster implementation in Node.js here.

## TODO

- Replace `__filename` with `import.meta.url`?
